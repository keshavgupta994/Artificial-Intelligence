# 8-Puzzle Problem using Depth First Search (DFS)

## Aim
To implement the *8-Puzzle Problem* using *Depth First Search (DFS)* and study its theoretical background, approach, and complexity analysis.

---

## Introduction
The *8-Puzzle Problem* is a classic problem in Artificial Intelligence. It consists of a 3 × 3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space (denoted as 0).  
The objective is to move the tiles by sliding them into the empty space until the grid reaches the *goal state*:

1 2 3 
4 5 6
7 8 9



Here, 0 represents the blank tile.

---

## Problem Definition
- *Initial State:* Any valid configuration of the 8-puzzle.
- *Goal State:* Tiles ordered sequentially from 1 to 8, with the blank (0) in the last position.
- *Operators:* Move the blank tile up, down, left, or right (when valid).
- *State Space:* All possible configurations of the puzzle.

---

## Approach: Depth First Search (DFS)

1. *Representation:*
   - Each puzzle state is represented as a 3×3 matrix.
   - The blank position (x, y) is tracked for valid moves.

2. *DFS Strategy:*
   - Use a *stack* to explore puzzle states.
   - At each step:
     - Pop the top state.
     - Check if it matches the goal configuration.
     - If not, generate possible next states by moving the blank tile in 4 directions.
     - Push these new states onto the stack.

3. *Termination:*
   - If the goal is found, stop the search.
   - If the stack becomes empty, report "Goal not found".

## Example Execution

### Input Start State


1 2 3
4 0 6
7 5 8



### DFS Expansion (Sample Sequence of States)

1 2 3 1 0 3 1 2 3
4 0 6 -> 4 2 6 -> 4 6 0
7 5 8 7 5 8 7 5 8



The search continues until the goal state is reached (or the stack empties).

---

## Time Complexity
- In the worst case, DFS may need to explore the entire state space.
- The 8-puzzle has at most 9! = 362,880 possible states.
- *Time Complexity:* O(b^d),  
  where b = branching factor (max 4 moves) and d = depth of the solution.  
  Worst case: O(9!).

---

## Space Complexity
- DFS uses a stack to store nodes in the current search path.
- At most, the stack depth equals the maximum depth of the state tree.
- *Space Complexity:* O(bd),  
  where d is the depth of the search.  
  Much less than BFS, which requires storing all nodes at the current frontier.

---

## Advantages of DFS
- Memory efficient compared to BFS.
- Simple to implement.
- May quickly find solutions that are deep in the search tree.

---

## Disadvantages of DFS
- May fall into infinite loops if not handled properly (no visited state tracking).
- Does not guarantee the shortest solution path.
- Can be inefficient in practice for large state spaces.

---

## Conclusion
The DFS approach to solving the 8-Puzzle problem explores states by diving deep into the search tree using a stack. While it is memory efficient, it does not guarantee the shortest path and may revisit states if not optimized with visited sets. This implementation serves as a foundation for understanding search strategies in Artificial Intelligence.
