# Tic Tac Toe using Minimax Algorithm

## Aim
To implement the Tic Tac Toe game in C++ where a human player competes against an AI opponent that uses the **Minimax Algorithm** based on **Game Theory** to always play optimally.

## Theory

### Game Theory
Game Theory is the study of decision-making in competitive situations where multiple players interact.  
In **Tic Tac Toe**, two players (Human and AI) take alternate turns, and the game is deterministic (no chance events).  
Optimal strategies ensure the best possible outcome regardless of the opponent’s moves.

### Minimax Algorithm
The **Minimax Algorithm** is a recursive decision-making algorithm used for two-player games:
- **Maximizer (AI)**: Tries to maximize its score (winning).  
- **Minimizer (Human)**: Tries to minimize AI’s score (forcing AI to lose or draw).  

The evaluation:
- **+10** → AI wins  
- **-10** → Human wins  
- **0** → Draw  

At each step:
1. AI simulates all possible moves.  
2. Human simulates all possible counter-moves.  
3. Backtracking propagates the best move upwards.  
4. AI selects the move that **maximizes its chance of winning**.  

This ensures that the AI **never loses** (at worst, it draws).

## Data Representation
- **Board:** A 3×3 matrix (`char board[3][3]`) with values:
  - `'X'` → Human move  
  - `'O'` → AI move  
  - `' '` → Empty cell  

- **Player Representation:**
  - Human → `PLAYER = 1`  
  - AI → `AI = 2`  

- **Functions Used:**
  - `initBoard()` → Initialize empty board  
  - `printBoard()` → Display current board state  
  - `checkWin()` → Check winner (`PLAYER`, `AI`, or none)  
  - `movesLeft()` → Check if moves remain  
  - `minimax()` → Core recursive algorithm  
  - `bestMove()` → Select optimal AI move  

---

## Methodology
1. Initialize the empty board.  
2. Human enters their move (`X`).  
3. AI calculates the **best possible move** using `minimax()`.  
4. Game continues until:
   - Human wins (`-10`)  
   - AI wins (`+10`)  
   - No moves left → Draw

## Time Complexity
- **Minimax explores the entire game tree.**  
- Total possible board states in Tic Tac Toe = **9! = 362,880**.  
- In practice, due to pruning (invalid/won states), the explored states are fewer.  

**Time Complexity:**  
- Worst Case: `O(b^d)`  
  - `b` = Branching factor (up to 9 moves)  
  - `d` = Depth of the tree (9 moves maximum)  
- For Tic Tac Toe: **O(9!) ≈ 362,880 evaluations** (still manageable).  

---

## Space Complexity
- The recursion stack depth can go up to **9** (maximum moves).  
- Additional memory for storing states is negligible.  

**Space Complexity:** `O(d)` = `O(9)` ≈ constant.

## Conclusion
The **Minimax Algorithm with Game Theory** ensures the AI plays optimally.  
- The AI **never loses** — it either wins or forces a draw.  
- Demonstrates the power of **adversarial search** in decision-making.  

This implementation is a fundamental example of applying **AI search strategies** in games.
